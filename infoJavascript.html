                While HTML5 and CSS3 lift your confidence by making you hands-on, the real user interactivity is
                achieved with the help of JavaScript and jQuery. With this you will be able to program event-driven web
                applications that are asynchronous in nature.

                JavaScript will do a deep dive into algorithms, problem solving and programming so that you can apply
                them in backend development also. Our approach in WSA ensures you will be able to learn any new
                programming language in future at ease.
