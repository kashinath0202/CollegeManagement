            <h3>(Project Development Code)</h3>
            <P>
                The second module is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is used for describing the look and formatting
                of a web-page created using HTML.CSS3 is a latest standard which supports certain advanced features like
                selectors, text effects, 2D/3D transformations, animations etc. CSS3 has been split into “modules” in
                order to support above mentioned features. This modularization helps to build enriched web-pages to give
                great UX. <br>

                With the combination of HTML5 and CSS3 you will be able to convert a given design (say in form of an
                image) into a responsive web-page that works well across PC, tablet and mobile screens.
